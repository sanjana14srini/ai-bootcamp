I want my agent to be able to extract the relevant documents from the arxiv api based on key words, perform search, summarization and comparison. It does not have to write anything back to the api/database.
Ultimately the agent should also be able to generate literature reviews when prompted by the user.

The scale and timing of the recession varied from country to country, and at the time, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded that it was the most severe economic and financial meltdown since the Great Depression. The recession officially began in the U.S. in December 2007 and lasted until June 2009, making it a 19-month recession. It led to a significant drop in international trade, rising unemployment, and slumping commodity prices.', references=[Reference(title='Wikipedia: Great Recession', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession')]), Section(heading='Causes', content='The causes of the Great Recession are attributed to the bursting of the housing bubble, which exposed the underappreciated risks of extensive mortgage-backed securities. Many banks and financial institutions failed when homeowners began to default on their mortgage payments, particularly those with subprime loans. This led to a crisis of confidence in the financial system, weakened consumer spending, and a substantial contraction in economic activity across many countries.', references=[Reference(title='Wikipedia: Causes of the Great Recession', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_the_Great_Recession')]), Section(heading='Effects', content='In the United States, the Great Recession resulted in approximately 8.7 million jobs being lost, with the unemployment rate peaking at 10.0% in October 2009.

Despite high spending on healthcare (17.8% of GDP), the outcomes are often not better than those in countries with universal healthcare systems.

    6. When is the best time to wake up in the morning?
    title='Sleep' sections=[Section(heading='Best Time to Wake Up', content="The best time to wake up is largely influenced by the individual's biological clock and natural sleep rhythms. Generally, most people experience the best quality of wakefulness after completing a full sleep cycle, which lasts roughly 90 minutes. For many, waking up during the lighter stages of sleep (like REM) instead of deep sleep can help avoid sleep inertia and make waking up feel more refreshing. Further, the optimal time for waking is often just after a period of REM sleep, which occurs more frequently towards the morning. This means that aligning wake times with the natural light-dark cycle helps regulate circadian rhythms and enhances alertness throughout the day.", references=[Reference(title='Understanding Sleep', url='https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/public-education/brain-basics/brain-basics-understanding-sleep'), Reference(title='Circadian Rhythms', url='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121745/')]), Section(heading='Sleep Timing Influences', content='The circadian clock plays a crucial role in determining the ideal wake-up time.
