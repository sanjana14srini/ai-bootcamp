--- Function Call ---
Function: search
Arguments: "{\"query\":\"threats to capybara populations\"}


Assistant: Capybara populations face several threats, including:

1. **Hunting**: Capybaras are hunted for their meat and hides in some areas of South America. This hunting pressure can lead to localized declines in their populations.

2. **Habitat Loss**: Deforestation and conversion of wetlands for agriculture or urban development reduce available habitats for capybaras. As they depend on dense vegetation near water bodies, habitat destruction impacts their survival.

3. **Competition with Livestock**: Farmers sometimes consider capybaras to be competitors for grazing resources. This perception can lead to intentional killings or control measures against them.

4. **Urbanization**: As human populations expand into capybara habitats, they may experience increased human-wildlife conflict. Capybaras may be displaced from their natural environments, leading to stresses on their populations.

5. **Ecosystem Changes**: Climate change and alterations to waterways can also affect capybara habitats and food sources, posing additional threats to their survival.

Despite these challenges, capybara populations are currently stable in many parts of their range, although local populations can fluctuate based on specific environmental and human factors.
