Q1. I would like to build an AI agent system that is able to automatically edit, 
render and export a (short-form) video from raw footage and open source music

Q2. The AI Agent system should be able to edit together a video based on raw footage data and instructions provided to it such as theme, narrative, length of the final video, flow and the emotion that the final video should invoke. Furthermore, the agent should also be able to take in human feedback to revise the video and finally also be able to upload/schedule an upload for the video to any desired platform such as YouTube, Instagram or TikTok along with generation and input of video title, description, timestamps etc.

Q3.External data will include the raw footage and any open source music. Alternatively, the music can also be fed in as part of the data.
