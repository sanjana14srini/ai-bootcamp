This repository holds all my work during the course of the AI Bootcamp: From RAG to Agents (https://maven.com/alexey-grigorev/from-rag-to-agents)
There is one folder for each week of the course, which contains code implementations from the lessons as well as my homework from the week

Bootcamp is in progress!
